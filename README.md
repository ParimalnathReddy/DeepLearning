# DeepLearning



Excited to share my first project on Fashion MNIST, a popular benchmark dataset for image classification tasks! This project involves training and evaluating machine learning models to recognize fashion items from grayscale images categorized into 10 classes. It's a great opportunity to delve into the world of computer vision and explore the capabilities of deep learning algorithms. Stay tuned for updates and insights as I embark on this exciting journey!
