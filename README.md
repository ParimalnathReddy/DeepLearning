Fashion MNIST is a benchmark dataset for image classification tasks, serving as a drop-in replacement for the classic MNIST dataset. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of fashion items categorized into 10 classes, including t-shirts, dresses, sneakers, and more. Each image is a 28x28 pixel array, making it suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models for image recognition tasks. Fashion MNIST is widely used in research and education to benchmark algorithms and compare performance on real-world image datasets.
